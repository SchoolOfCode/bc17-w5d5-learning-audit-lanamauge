I've done individual practice in the following areas:

- Built a simple API express (+ remote database) server which acts like a playlist (you can add new songs and retrieve all songs): https://github.com/lanamauge/playlist_api.git
- Experimented with import/exports: https://github.com/lanamauge/node_import_export_practice
